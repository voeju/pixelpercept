# PixelPercept
With PixelPercept, my team and I developed an image classifier in 2023 with a GUI from scratch with Java distinguishing five drawings: a bowtie, a cloud, a t-shirt, an envelope and the sun.
Our application lets you draw your own drawings that will be classified with our deep neural network we built with Java without a ML dedicated framework.
As train and test samples we used the respective open source drawings from Google Quickdraw.
At the end, our classifier achieved an accuracy of more than 0.98.
